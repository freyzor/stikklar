My quadruped bioloid based robot project


These are the Arbotix firmwares for the wheeled quadruped Stikklar.
Initially base on PyPose/NUKE for the base IK and gait engine.

These libraries are required for Arduino to make these work:

* Bioloid => https://github.com/trossenrobotics/arbotix
* Commander => https://github.com/trossenrobotics/arbotix
* FMS => http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/FiniteStateMachine

The python scripts use mathplot for plotting
